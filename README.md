Decision Tree Classification – Breast Cancer Dataset

This project demonstrates how to build and evaluate a Decision Tree Classifier using the Breast Cancer dataset from scikit-learn. The model predicts whether a tumor is benign or malignant based on medical features.

📌 Project Overview

Algorithm: Decision Tree Classifier

Dataset: Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset (built-in sklearn dataset)

Task: Binary classification

Evaluation Metric: Accuracy

📂 Dataset Description

The dataset contains features computed from digitized images of breast mass samples.

Total samples: 569

Features: 30 numeric features

Target values:

0 → Malignant

1 → Benign

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

scikit-learn

NumPy

📜 Code Explanation

Load the breast cancer dataset

Split data into training (75%) and testing (25%)

Train a Decision Tree Classifier

Predict outcomes on test data
